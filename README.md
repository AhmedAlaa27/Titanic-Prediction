# Titanic Survival Prediction Model

## Overview

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The dataset used is the well-known Titanic dataset, which includes various features about the passengers and whether they survived the disaster. The goal is to use this data to create a predictive model that can determine the likelihood of survival based on the passenger's attributes.

## Project Structure

- **`Titanic.ipynb`**: The Jupyter notebook containing the code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation.
- **`data/`**: Directory containing the Titanic dataset (not included in the repository; users should download it from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)).

## Steps Involved

1. - **Data Loading**:
    - The Titanic dataset is loaded into a pandas Data Frame for analysis.
    - This data typically includes features like Passenger Class, Sex, Age, Fare, and whether the passenger survived.
- **Data Exploration**:
    - The dataset is explored to understand the distribution of data, missing values, and relationships between features.
- **Data Cleaning**:
    - Missing values are handled appropriately, often through imputation strategies (e.g., filling missing ages with the median age).
    - Irrelevant features or those with too many missing values are dropped.
- **Feature Engineering**:
    - Categorical variables like 'Sex' and 'Embarked' are encoded into numerical values.
- **Data Splitting**:
    - The data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data.
    - A typical split might be 80% for training and 20% for testing.
- **Model Selection**:
    - Various machine learning models are considered, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or KNN.
- **Model Training**:
    - The selected model is trained on the training data.
    - Hyperparameters are tuned to optimize the model's performance.
- **Model Evaluation**:
    - The model is evaluated using accuracy metric.
- **Model Interpretation**:
    - Feature importance is analyzed to understand which features contribute most to the model's predictions.
    - Insights gained from the model are interpreted in the context of the Titanic dataset.
- **Prediction**:
    - The model is used to predict the survival of passengers in the test set.
    - Results are compared with actual outcomes to measure the modelâ€™s effectiveness.
- **Conclusion**:
    - The findings from the model are summarized.
